# OUR MISSION

> “प्रमाणयुक्ता चिकित्सा एव सत्यमार्गः। अप्रमाणिककल्पना रोगनाशिनी न भवति।”

EBM Daily is a student led initiative formed to promote evidence based medicine and scientific thinking in healthcare. It was created in response to the increasing spread of medical misinformation pseudoscience and unverified treatment claims that often mislead the public and put patient safety at risk.

The aim of EBM Daily is to encourage medical students doctors and healthcare professionals to question claims critically and rely on scientifically validated evidence rather than belief tradition or authority. The platform provides a space where students can write learn and engage with medical topics while following ethical principles and scientific integrity.

EBM Daily also works to analyse and challenge unscientific practices by explaining why they fail under modern medical research and clinical evidence. Its long term vision is to build a credible community driven platform that improves medical literacy supports rational healthcare decisions and reinforces the idea that real medicine must always be guided by evidence not opinion.
