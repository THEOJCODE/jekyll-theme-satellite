Ayurveda textbook claims "big penis" or excessive sex causes vaginal diseases – This is why we need evidence-based medicine  

Found this gem circulating online from an English translation of Charaka Samhita (one of the foundational texts of Ayurveda). Chapter 38 of the "Treatment of diseases of vagina" section literally states:

> "The woman who copulates much with a man having big penis, or with other men excessively, she who is dry, debilitated or very young, vāta gets aggravated in her body, becomes localised in the vagina and gives rise to diseases of the vagina."

It goes on to say these 20 vaginal disorders are caused by "indulgence in improper activities, disorders of menstrual fluid, abnormalities of the seed (ovum) and act of God (providence)."

This is not ancient wisdom. This is ancient pseudoscience dressed up as medicine.

There is zero empirical evidence linking penis size or frequency of consensual sex to "vāta aggravation" or any specific vaginal pathology. Modern gynaecology recognises real causes: infections (bacterial vaginosis, yeast, STIs), hormonal changes, autoimmune conditions, trauma, etc. – all diagnosable with tests and treatable with proven interventions.

Ayurveda, like many traditional systems, contains some observational knowledge mixed with massive amounts of superstition, vitalism, and outright harmful ideas. It has never been subjected to rigorous, controlled trials for most of its claims, and when it has, results are usually negative or explained by placebo/active ingredients also found in conventional medicine.

Please, if you or someone you care about has gynaecological symptoms: see an actual doctor. Get proper examination, cultures, and evidence-based treatment. Don’t risk your health on 2,000-year-old guesses about wind doshas and divine providence.

Trust science, not superstition.

What’s the wildest medical claim you’ve seen from traditional/alternative medicine? Drop it in the comments.  

**TL;DR:** Ancient Ayurvedic text blames vaginal diseases on big penises and too much sex. Modern medicine > ancient guesswork.
