# Student Led Initiative for Evidence Based Medicine

> EBM Daily is a student led initiative focused on promoting evidence based medicine. It is run by medical students with the aim of encouraging scientific thinking rational decision making and ethical healthcare. The platform allows students and healthcare professionals to write share and discuss medically verified content while actively questioning pseudoscience misinformation and unproven medical claims. The core idea is simple real medicine must be based on evidence not beliefs.
